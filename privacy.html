  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 04/13/2025 </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This privacy policy describes how the Boycott Palestine Extension ("we", "our", or "the extension") handles your information while using the extension. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting the data you share with us.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      The Boycott Palestine Extension does not collect any personal data from users. The extension only compares data with a locally stored script (bundled with the extension) to determine whether a visited website is on a predefined list. The extension operates completely offline and does not access or store any user data, including browsing history or personal information.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>3. Data Access</h2>
    <p>
      The extension only has access to the hostname of the websites you visit. It checks the hostname against a local script to determine if it matches any predefined boycott criteria. No other data is collected or transmitted outside of your device.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>4. Data Usage</h2>
    <p>
      The extension uses the hostname data to display a notification when you visit a website that is on the boycott list. The data is processed locally on your device, and no data is shared with any third-party services.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>5. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
      Since we do not collect any personal or browsing data, no information is stored beyond what is required for the extensionâ€™s functionality. All data used for comparisons is stored locally within the extension itself and is not transmitted over the internet.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>6. Third-Party Access</h2>
    <p>
      We do not share any user data with third parties. The extension operates fully offline, and no external servers or services are involved in the processing of data.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Since we do not collect personal data, there are no specific rights you need to manage or revoke. However, you can choose to uninstall the extension at any time.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in how the extension operates. If any significant changes occur, we will notify users through an update to the privacy policy page. Please check this page periodically for updates.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy or the extension, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:adechemi96@gmail.com">adechemi96@gmail.com</a>.
